        RuntimeError: dispatch error: slot pool exhausted for mcu=1
        (capacity=4, in_flight=4); awaiting kalico_credit_freed
        retirement events

    Bridge transitions to shutdown; H7 'mcu' and F4 'bottom' both get
    'Command request' shutdown reasons.

    Root cause (from the live log):
      - F4 'bottom' MCU (owns Z, CONFIG_RUNTIME_CURVE_POOL_N=4) never
        advances its runtime engine past segment_id=0 across the entire
        session — verified across ~105k log lines after configure_axes,
        F4 status frames only ever report current_segment_id=0.
      - F4 therefore never emits kalico_credit_freed, so the host's
        F4 slot pool never retires.
      - Per the 2026-05-11 dispatch fix (rust/motion-bridge/src/dispatch.rs:
        ``x_move_sends_curves_for_every_kinematic_axis_on_each_mcu``), every
        ShapedSegment dispatches a Z curve to F4 even on pure-XY jogs
        because Z is in the kinematics bitmask.
      - 4-jog sequence fills the F4 slot pool; the 5th try_alloc raises
        SlotPoolExhausted{mcu_id=1, capacity=4, in_flight=4}.

    Sim adaptation: pin-overrides shrinks position_max to 20, so we
    cannot start at X=100 like the bench. Use small jogs near origin to
    stay within the shrunken bounds; the slot-pool accounting is
    independent of dx magnitude (1 F4 slot per ShapedSegment regardless
    of geometry).

    Asserted behavior: with the 2026-05-17 fix in place, all 10 jogs
    must succeed. The fix has two parts in rust/runtime/src/engine.rs:
      - Engine::push_segment no longer CASes producer_pending. Previously
        it raced the C-side `kalico_runtime_kick_producer` CAS; Engine
        always won, leaving the C-side's `arm_producer_timer_if_kicked`
        with a failed CAS and no scheduled producer timer. On pure-
        Modulated MCUs (F4 phase-stepped Z with no StepTime motor to
        drive step_time_event re-kicks) this left the producer timer
        un-armed forever.
      - producer_step unconditionally dequeues at the top so Modulated-
        only configs see segment cursor advance. The per-motor StepTime
        loop below `continue`s on every non-StepTime motor, so without
        the top-of-function dequeue `fetch_segment_for_motor` was never
        called for pure-Modulated configs and `producer_current` stayed
        None → `runtime_modulated_tick` no-op'd → segments never retired.
    Both fixes are required: the first re-arms the timer so producer_step
    actually runs; the second makes producer_step useful for Modulated-
    only MCUs.
