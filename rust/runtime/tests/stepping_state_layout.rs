//! Smoke test for `stepping_state` — verifies the module compiles in
//! isolation. The broader `runtime` lib-test build is currently blocked
//! by pre-existing `Consumer<Segment>` mismatches in `engine.rs` (see
//! 2026-05-19 plan, Task 6 verification path (d)); this integration
//! test sidesteps those by linking only what `stepping_state` actually
//! depends on.
