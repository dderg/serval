//! Integration tests for the per-axis piece-ring ISR tick path.
//!
//! Exercises the full pipeline: configure_axis → push_pieces → tick → verify
//! observable state.  Tests cover:
//!   - Arming a piece when start_time is reached
//!   - Holding at t=0 before start_time (future piece adopted into cache)
//!   - Idle behaviour with an empty ring
//!   - Hard fault when a piece's start_time exceeds the drift-budget tolerance
//!   - Within-tolerance arming (1 tick late — must NOT fault)
//!   - Advancing through consecutive pieces
//!   - push_pieces rejection when the ring is full
