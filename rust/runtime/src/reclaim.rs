//! Foreground trace-drain → curve-pool reclaim pipeline. Per spec §10.4.
//!
//! On observing `SEGMENT_END(slot=N, gen=G)` in the trace stream, foreground
//! sets `slot[N].last_retired_gen = G`. FIFO ordering of single-ISR-writer
//! single-foreground-reader `heapless::spsc` preserves the per-slot
//! retirement sequence; no separate "any queued segment references this
//! slot" inspection is needed.
//!
//! Producer is expected to drain pending trace samples before failing alloc
//! due to "no reclaimable slot."
//!
//! ## Multi-handle retirement (Task 7)
//!
//! Each logical segment maps to up to 4 per-axis scalar curve slots (X, Y, Z,
//! E). The trace sample carries only `x_handle` for diagnostics; the
//! foreground learns all 4 handles at push time via `RetirementTable::register`
//! and looks them up on `SEGMENT_END` via `RetirementTable::lookup`.
