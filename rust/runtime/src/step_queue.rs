//! Rust mirror of the C-side `StepQueue` (`src/step_queue.h`).
//!
//! Storage is owned by C — on the MCU, the C translation unit declares a
//! `[StepQueue; N_AXIS_STEP_QUEUES]` placed in `.axi_bss` (or equivalent),
//! and this module provides typed accessors via the `step_queues` extern.
//! On host / test builds, callers construct `StepQueue::new()` instances
//! on the stack or in a `Box` and pass `*mut StepQueue` into the free
//! functions below.
//!
//! The queue is a single-producer / single-consumer ring buffer of power-of-two
//! depth (`STEP_QUEUE_DEPTH = 32`) using free-running `u16` counters; the slot
//! index is `counter & STEP_QUEUE_DEPTH_MASK`. Counter wraparound is correct
//! by construction because `tail.wrapping_sub(head)` returns the populated
//! length even when `tail` has wrapped past `head` — both unsigned values
//! advance monotonically modulo `2^16`, and the difference modulo `2^16`
//! equals the true outstanding count whenever it is `< 2^16` (here it is
//! bounded by `STEP_QUEUE_DEPTH = 32`).
//!
//! Cross-core ordering on the H7 follows the standard SPSC release/acquire
//! discipline: the producer fills `buf[slot]` then publishes via a Release
//! fence + volatile write to `tail`; the consumer reads `tail` first, takes
//! an Acquire fence, then consumes `buf[slot]`. Volatile counter accesses
//! prevent the compiler from caching them across the fence.
