//! Fault-raising helpers for the unified stepping engine.
//!
//! Each helper publishes a `(fault_code, fault_detail)` pair on
//! [`SharedState`] in the canonical order: detail first, then code. The
//! ordering matters because the foreground status frame reads `last_error`
//! to decide whether to surface `fault_detail` at all; storing the detail
//! first guarantees that a foreground reader observing a non-zero
//! `last_error` always sees the populated detail.
//!
//! `fault_detail` encoding (per spec
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-19-stepping-redesign-design.md` §9.2):
//! the top byte is reserved; bits 16..24 hold the axis (or per-axis
//! stepper) index, the lower bits are fault-specific context.
//!
//! These helpers are intentionally tiny — they exist so that the hot path
//! (TIM5 ISR) does not have to spell out the two-store sequence inline at
//! every call site, and so the encoding stays in one place when the fault
//! taxonomy evolves.
