//! Half-split runtime state per Step-6 spec §11.
//!
//! `FgState` is touched only from foreground command-dispatch.
//! `IsrState` is touched only from the TIM5 ISR.
//! `SharedState` is touched concurrently from both via atomics only.
//!
//! Discipline contract: code-review-enforced. No compiler check. The TIM5
//! ISR is the SOLE writer of `IsrState`; any other interrupt that needs MCU
//! state goes through `SharedState` atomics.
//!
//! `TickState` is the per-tick struct shared with the PA/IS slot pipeline
//! and predates the half-split — it stays in this module.

// The half-split FFI projection (see `init` below) needs raw-pointer writes
// through `MaybeUninit` and an `unsafe impl Sync` for `RuntimeContext`; the
// foreign symbol declarations for `runtime_clock_freq` / `irq_save` /
// `irq_restore` also require `unsafe extern "C"`. Workspace lints deny
// `unsafe_code` globally — this module is one of two places in `runtime`
// (alongside `curve_pool::load_unchecked`) where we opt out, with the
// rationale documented inline.
