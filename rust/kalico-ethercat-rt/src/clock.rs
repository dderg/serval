//! System-wide monotonic clock in nanoseconds (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC`).

//! `std::time::Instant` reads `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` but its value is opaque and
//! anchored per-process, so timestamps are NOT comparable between the endpoint
//! and the test client. The raw `CLOCK_MONOTONIC` epoch is shared by every
//! process on the host, so reading it directly gives both processes one common
//! timeline — which is what makes `PushSegment.t_start`/`t_end` (absolute ns)
//! meaningful across the socket. This is the M1 shared-clock substrate; Plan 2
//! will layer a negotiated host↔endpoint reference on the same primitive.
