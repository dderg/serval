//! Off-loop executor for CoE mailbox traffic.
//!
//! SDO transactions block for milliseconds to seconds (mailbox round trips,
//! the drive's internal EEPROM save, SOEM's 700 ms per-attempt timeout). The
//! DC loop must keep process data flowing every cycle — a slave in OP drops
//! to SAFE-OP (ErC1.1, emergency 0x8700) when cyclic frames pause past its
//! sync watchdog. So mailbox work runs on this dedicated thread while the DC
//! loop keeps cycling; SOEM's Linux port serializes socket access internally,
//! which is exactly the concurrent PDO-thread + mailbox-thread split its own
//! examples use.
//!
//! Requests execute strictly in submission order (single worker, FIFO
//! channel), preserving write-then-readback semantics per client call.
//!
//! The worker shares SOEM's one raw socket with the DC loop, so its
//! scheduling matters as much as its existence: see
//! [`crate::thread_prio::assume_companion_rt_scheduling`] for why the
//! hardware endpoint must run it as a pinned low-priority SCHED_FIFO
//! companion rather than SCHED_OTHER.
