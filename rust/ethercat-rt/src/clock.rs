//! Nanoseconds on the host-wide `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` timeline.
//!
//! `std::time::Instant` is per-process; a shared POSIX clock is required for
//! piece `start_time` values to be comparable between the host pump and this
//! endpoint. `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` is used (not `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`) because the
//! host's `instant_to_f64` anchor is also RAW-domain on Linux
//! (`host-rt` uses `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` for `monotonic_raw_secs`), so
//! the init-planner seed that pairs `Instant::now()` with this value lands both
//! sides in the same domain and the linear mapping (freq 1e9) stays exact.
//!
//! On macOS (CI / development) `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` exists and is available
//! via libc. The endpoint binary only ships on Linux; the macOS path runs
//! in tests only.
